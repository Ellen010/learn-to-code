# JavaScript Â· Course Notes

#### The ultimate guide to *JavaScript Algorithms & Data Structures* ðŸ”¥

JavaScript was the most popular programming language of 2023, and there's good reason why. It can be used for dynamic programming, web development, backend development, ML & AI and the list goes on. It's perhaps not the easiest language, but it's also not the hardest, and with time you can undoubtly become a JavaScript maestro too!

-- *The goal is to become familiar with the material and understand it, not to memorize it. All great developers have reference material they regularly refer to and this resource will always be here should you need it :)*

## Chapter 1 - Introduction to JavaScript (JS)

As mentioned above, JavaScript is a programming language that has a myriad of uses and applications. Before we dive head deep into the programming language itself and write some nifty applications, we first need to understand it's *ecosystem*; i.e. how we run it and how it works.

The best way to think about JavaScript is to imagine it's an instruction sheet, where the instructions are defined using a *syntax* that is specific to the language, and the script/instruction sheet is executed/run on a machine (could also be a virtual or cloud machine) or in a browser such as Google Chrome or Firefox.

To learn JavaScript, we'll first cover how to develop and run JavaScript scripts on our local machine (server-side development), and later learn how it can used in the browser and in web development.

### 1.1 Get JavaScript Setup on your Computer

To run a JavaScript file on your device, we're going to need what is known as a ***runtime***. Without diving too deep into what a runtime is, just think of it as a system setup to execute JavaScript files.

#### 1.1.1 Node.js

The runtime we'll be using is known as **Node.js**. All we need to do to get up and running with Node.js is to:

1. Install Node.js on our computer/device.
    - Link to install -> (install)[https://nodejs.org/en/download]

2. Once installed, we can interact with Node.js via the terminal/command line.
    - Type `node -v` in your terminal to ensure that Node.js is installed correctly.
        - If Node is not installed, you will receive and error, and otherwise, it will console (print out) the current version of Node installed.

-- *It might serve to know that you can use a web-based runtime if your just looking to fiddle around with JavaScript. You can find a link to one [here](https://onecompiler.com/javascript).*

### 1.2 Creating an JavaScript Script

Now that we have Node.js installed, we can go ahead and create our first JavaScript file. Using VSCode & inside of a *project directory*, we initialize a new file, just as if we we're create a standard word document, can giving it any name followed by the ```.js``` suffix. For example -> 

**index.js**

-- *Standard practice for JavaScript file names is to use `index.js` as your default file, and then any other JS file can have a more specifc name, for example `server.js` or `tests.js`.*

With the `index.js` file created, I now want you to write the following line of code inside of your JS file.

`console.log('Hello World!')`

Now save the file, and once again open up your terminal or command line. Ensuring that you are inside of the correct project directory *(the same one as the one that contains your JS file)*, type the following command and hit **Enter**.

`node index.js`

This will execute your JS file and consequently perform the instruction that we gave inside, which was to *console.log* (which means print / to log to the console/terminal) `Hello World!`. To run any other JS file, simply replace the `index.js` filename with the appropriate filename.
