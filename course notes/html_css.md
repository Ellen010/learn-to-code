## Chapter 1 - Introduction to HTML

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, and it's technically not a programming language, but instead, a markup language. For now, we'll think of it as a glorified word document. In a word document, you can create text headers, add links, display images and well, HTML isn't that different.

### Creating an HTML Document

To get started coding in HTML, we first need to create an HTML document. We can do that by initializing a new file, just as if we we're create a standard word document, can giving it any name followed by the ```.html``` suffix. For example -> 

**index.html**

This file should be located within a folder that is know as your *project directory*. We can have multiple HTML files within the project directory, where each file can be used as a subroute for our HTML webpage. 

The default HTML page will always be the one named *index.html*. An example project directory is as follows:

```
project_directory
|- index.html
|- about.html
|- contact.html
```

### Initializing an HTML Document

Now that we have our project created our document, we can go ahead and open it up. HTML documents always start off with a little bit of boilerplate code that looks as follows:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Document</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        visible content goes here . . .
    </body>
</html>
```
