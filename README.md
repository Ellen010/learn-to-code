 #### The ultimate guide to *learning to code* & full stack development that will *land you a job* in no time!

 ## Prologue

 Hi,

 I'm James, a self-taught software developer, and this guide is the roadmap I wish I had as I endeavored to learn programming with the ultimate goal of being employed as a software developer. Successful as I was, it was a journey wrought with peril and with the knowledge I have today, there are many things I would do differently & better. 
 
 With this guide, hopefully you too can learn to code (even if you have no prior experience) and land your developer role!

Finally, time for the good stuff!

### Chapter 1 - HTML CSS & GIT

*Completion time **[3hrs]***

We begin our journey with HTML CSS & GIT. The first two are essentially the backbone of the internet, and are the perfect entry point for beginner developers. GIT on the otherhand, is a code version management that companies use to organize their work.
