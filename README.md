# Learn To Code Â· Roadmap
 #### The ultimate guide to *learning to code* & full stack development that will *land you a job* in no time!

 ## Foreword

 Hi,

 I'm James, a self-taught software developer, and this guide is the roadmap I wish I had as I endeavored to learn programming with the ultimate goal of being employed as a software developer. Successful as I was, it was a journey wrought with peril and with the knowledge I have today, there are many things I would do differently & better. 
 
 With this guide, hopefully you too can learn to code (even if you have no prior experience) and land your developer role!

## Learning To Code

Finally, time for the good stuff!

### Chapter 1 - HTML CSS & GIT

*Completion time **[2.5hrs]***

We begin our journey with HTML CSS & GIT. The first two are essentially the backbone of the internet, and are the perfect entry point for beginner developers. GIT on the otherhand, is a code version management that companies use to organize their work.

#### End of Chapter Project

Build your first ever Single Page Application (SPA) - a portfolio website showcasing your coding skills! Using only HTML and CSS, create a responsive website with sections for introducing yourself, listing your skills and projects, and providing contact details. Don't hesitate to experiment with design and interactive elements (it doesn't need to be perfect).

Once your masterpiece is complete & deployed, share your project URL in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/BYr6gujs4k) channel let everyone be wowed by your skills!
