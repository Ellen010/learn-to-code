# Learn To Code ¬∑ Roadmap
 #### The ultimate guide to *learning to code* & full stack development that will *land you a job* in no time!

 ## Foreword

 Hi,

 I'm James, a self-taught software developer, and this guide is the roadmap I wish I had as I endeavored to learn programming with the ultimate goal of being employed as a software developer. Successful as I was, it was a journey fraught with peril and with the knowledge I have today, there are many things I would do differently & better. You can learn more about my journey [here ->](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nP0-oYGiqts)
 
 With this guide, hopefully you too can learn to code (even if you have no prior experience) and land your developer role!

### Chapter 1 - HTML CSS & GIT

*Completion time **[10hrs]***

We begin our journey with HTML CSS & GIT. The first two are essentially the backbone of the internet, and are the perfect entry point for beginner developers. GIT on the otherhand, is a code version management that companies use to organize their work.

## Projects

Now that you've got the knowledge you need to start building some wicked full stack web applications, here's my recommendation for the best trio of projects to include in your web portfolio.

**Projects do not need to be overly complex, just clean and well coded**

1. [Web portfolio](https://youtu.be/ylCUH6LkW80) -> You'll need somewhere to store you work
*Recommended to use a JavaScript framework combined with TailwindCSS*

2. Frontend Framework (e.g. React.js or Next.js) that consumes an API (weather app, pokemon pokedex etc.)

3. An API project that uses the REST methodologies with Node.js, Express.js and PostgreSQL. Bonus points if you can contain it within a Docker Container and combine it with the ChatGPT API.

4. A Full Stack project using a frontend framework (React.js or SvelteKit), Firebase auth, Firebase Firestore database & TailwindCSS. This could be a calender app, a todo app, or even a recipe app.
